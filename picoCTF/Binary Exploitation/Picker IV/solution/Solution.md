## Description ##
Can you figure out how this program works to get the flag?

## Approach ##
I am provided with a binary file called `picker-IV` and a C file called `picker-IV.c`. Inspecting the C file, I can that the `win` address prints the flag, the `main` address reads the user input, casts user input to a function pointer and jumps to that address. If I can figure out the `win` address, I can jump to it and print the flag:

  unsigned int val;
  printf("Enter the address in hex to jump to, excluding '0x': ");
  scanf("%x", &val);
  printf("You input 0x%x\n", val);

  void (*foo)(void) = (void (*)())val;
  foo();

The `win` address can be found using `disassemble` in `gdb`:

   pwndbg> disas win
   Dump of assembler code for function win:
   0x000000000040129e <+0>:     endbr64

The start of the `win` function is at `0x40129e`:

    Enter the address in hex to jump to, excluding '0x': 40129e
    You input 0x40129e
    You won!
    picoCTF{n3v3r_jump_t0_u53r_5uppl13d_4ddr35535_14bc5444}

Flag: picoCTF{n3v3r_jump_t0_u53r_5uppl13d_4ddr35535_14bc5444}

## Reflection ## 
This is a simple binary exploitation challenge. I can use a debugger to find the `win` address and jump to it.
